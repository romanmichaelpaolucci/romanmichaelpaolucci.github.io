*Course Description:
This course is a gentle technical introduction to the world of computer science and its many areas of study. This course takes a severely practical approach to education deeply rooted in theory. Students will waste little time on abstractions and dive right into learning to code as a tool for solving meaningful problems. Python is overwhelmingly the language of choice for academics and industrial practitioners alike and is where the course will begin.
