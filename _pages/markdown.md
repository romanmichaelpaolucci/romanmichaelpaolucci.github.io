Hey there, I am currently a MS student at Columbia studying Operations Research concentrating in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I hold a bachelor's degree from James Madison University in Mathematics and Quantitative Finance. Currently, I am Computer Science faculty at Saddle River Day School developing and teaching their data science curriculum. I am also their AI Specialist aiding in product development and faculty-product integration.

In my free time I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Mike Wilson. I am currently a purple belt and enjoy competing at regional competitions.
