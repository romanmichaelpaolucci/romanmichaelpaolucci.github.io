News
======
Have a great summer break!

I am currently preparing for the 2024-2025 school year - we will be running the following courses: Computer Science 1, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence

If you are interested in the curriculum for these courses please see [Teaching](/teaching/). Feel free to reach out with any questions or to say hi by sending an email to roman[dot]paolucci[at]Columbia[dot]edu.

I have a great deal of interest in non-convex optimization problems. What's that you might ask? Check out [this interactive app](https://gd-sgd.streamlit.app/) to understand more about this problem and its relationship to machine learning and artificial intelligence!

Course Resources
======
There tends to be a lot of interest in the projects developed in the courses I teach. Below you will find a set of links to interactive streamlit versions of the models and apps I teach my students to build sorted by course.
